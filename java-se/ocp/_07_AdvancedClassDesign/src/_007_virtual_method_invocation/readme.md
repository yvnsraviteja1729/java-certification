## **Virtual Method Invocation in Java**

### **Definition**

Virtual Method Invocation (also known as **Dynamic Method Dispatch**) is a **runtime mechanism** in Java where an **overridden method** is called based on the **actual object type** (not the reference type). This enables **polymorphism**, allowing Java to dynamically decide which method implementation to execute.

---

## **How Virtual Method Invocation Works**

1. **A superclass reference variable can refer to a subclass object**.
2. **When an overridden method is called on this reference, the method from the actual subclass is executed at runtime** (not the one in the reference type).
3. **Java uses a concept called the "vtable" (virtual method table) to resolve method calls dynamically**.

---

## **Example: Virtual Method Invocation in Action**

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal;  // Superclass reference

        myAnimal = new Dog();
        myAnimal.makeSound();  // Output: Dog barks (not Animal makes a sound)

        myAnimal = new Cat();
        myAnimal.makeSound();  // Output: Cat meows (not Animal makes a sound)
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**

- The reference variable `myAnimal` is of type `Animal`, but it **refers to objects of different subclasses (`Dog`, `Cat`)**.
- **Even though `myAnimal` is declared as `Animal`, the overridden method of the actual object (`Dog` or `Cat`) is executed.**
- This decision happens **at runtime**, making the method invocation **virtual**.

---

## **Key Points About Virtual Method Invocation**

1. **Works only with overridden methods**

   - If a method is **not overridden**, the method from the reference type is executed.

2. **Happens at runtime**

   - Java dynamically determines which method to execute based on the actual object type.

3. **Does not apply to static, private, or final methods**

   - These methods are **resolved at compile time**, not runtime.
   - Example:

     ```java
     class Animal {
         static void staticMethod() {
             System.out.println("Animal static method");
         }
     }

     class Dog extends Animal {
         static void staticMethod() {
             System.out.println("Dog static method");
         }
     }

     public class Test {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Animal myAnimal = new Dog();
             myAnimal.staticMethod(); // Output: Animal static method (Not Dog's method)
         }
     }
     ```

   - Static methods **do not** participate in virtual method invocation because they are **resolved at compile time**.

4. **Used for achieving Polymorphism**
   - It enables **flexibility** and **code reusability** by allowing subclasses to define their own behavior while still being referenced using the superclass.

## **Example: Virtual Method Invocation in a Real-World Scenario**

### **Scenario:** A zoo management system where different animals eat differently.

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void eat();

    void careFor() {
        System.out.println("Caring for the animal...");
        eat();  // Calls the overridden method from the subclass
    }
}

class Lion extends Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Lion eats meat");
    }
}

class Deer extends Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Deer eats grass");
    }
}

public class Zoo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal lion = new Lion();
        lion.careFor();

        Animal deer = new Deer();
        deer.careFor();
    }
}
```

### **Output**

```
Caring for the animal...
Lion eats meat

Caring for the animal...
Deer eats grass
```

### **Explanation**

- The `careFor()` method **is inherited from `Animal`**, but it calls `eat()`, which is **overridden in subclasses (`Lion` and `Deer`)**.
- The method `eat()` is executed based on **the actual object type**, demonstrating **virtual method invocation**.

---

## **Conclusion**

- **Virtual Method Invocation** enables **runtime polymorphism** by ensuring the correct overridden method is executed based on the **actual object type**.
- It allows Java programs to be **flexible, extensible, and maintainable** by allowing method behavior to be dynamically selected at runtime.
- **Java always invokes overridden methods based on the runtime type of an object, not the compile-time type of the reference variable.**
