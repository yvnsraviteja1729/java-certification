In Java, the **`protected`** access modifier is one of the four access control levels, alongside `public`, `private`, and the default (package-private). The `protected` modifier provides a level of access that is more restrictive than `public`, but less restrictive than `private`.

### **`protected` Access Modifier:**
- **Within the same package:** The members of a class (fields, methods) that are marked `protected` can be accessed within the same package.
- **In subclasses (even if they are in different packages):** `protected` members can be accessed in subclasses, even if the subclass is in a different package than the class containing the protected members.
- **Not accessible from other classes (outside of package and subclass):** If the class is not a subclass, or itâ€™s not within the same package, the `protected` members are not accessible.

### **Access Levels Comparison:**

| Access Modifier | Same Package | Subclass (Different Package) | Other Classes (Different Package) |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `public`        | Yes          | Yes                          | Yes                              |
| `protected`     | Yes          | Yes                          | No                               |
| Default (package-private) | Yes          | No                           | No                               |
| `private`       | No           | No                           | No                               |

### **Key Points About `protected`:**
- A `protected` field or method is **accessible**:
    - Within the same package.
    - In subclasses, even if the subclass is in a different package.
- A `protected` field or method is **not accessible**:
    - Outside the package and not through inheritance (i.e., from a non-subclass).

### **When to Use `protected`:**
The `protected` modifier is particularly useful when you want to allow subclasses to access and modify certain fields or methods, but you still want to restrict access from other classes that are not part of the inheritance chain. This can be useful in cases where you are designing an API or framework where subclasses need to interact with certain implementation details, but you don't want to expose them publicly.
